<h1 title="">The Geologic Story of Palo Duro Canyon</h1>
<p class="center">William H. Mathews III<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<h2 id="c1">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Like the early Spanish explorers who
first saw Palo Duro Canyon, today&rsquo;s visitor
is likely to view the impressive canyon
with surprise and awe. This great depression&mdash;it
is more than 2 miles wide and as
much as 800 feet deep within park boundaries&mdash;contains
a fascinating assortment of
multicolored <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">geologic formations</a> and erosion-produced
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> sculptures of many
shapes, colors, and size. The geographic
setting of the canyon further heightens its
impact on the visitor, for it is surrounded
by the level, virtually treeless plains of the
Texas Panhandle. (<i>See</i> upper background
area in <a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>, frontispiece).</p>
<p>It is not surprising that this scenic area
has been set aside as a State park, for Palo
Duro Canyon has long been of interest to
man. First, as the hunting grounds of prehistoric
Indians who stalked the now-extinct
<a class="gloss" href="#g_IceAge">Ice Age</a> mammoths and bison that
roamed the valley floor. Later, the canyon
was frequented by the Comanches,
Apaches, Kiowas, and other Indians of
historic time. These tribes, like those before
them, found both food and refuge
within the canyon. However, it was not
until 1876 that Palo Duro Canyon was inhabited
by the white man. It was during
this year that pioneer cattleman Charles
Goodnight herded some 1,600 head of
cattle into the canyon and established a
camp there (<a href="#Page_6">p. 6</a>).</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s visitor to Palo Duro Canyon
can re-live some of the fascinating history
of this interesting area. One can still see a
replica of Colonel Goodnight&rsquo;s primitive
dugout, follow the faint trace of the Comanche
Trail, or perhaps find the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a>
bones of prehistoric creatures that lived
hundreds of thousands&mdash;even millions&mdash;of
years ago. But most visitors to Texas&rsquo; most
colorful canyon are not attracted by its
interesting history. They come instead to
enjoy the scenery and recreational opportunities
that are present. These are readily
accessible, for a carefully engineered, hard-surface
road leads from the rim of the
canyon to the canyon floor. There are
campgrounds, picnic areas, concessions,
and even an outdoor theatre (<a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>). The
location of these facilities and some of the
canyon&rsquo;s more interesting geologic features
are shown on the generalized place
map of the canyon (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>).</p>
<p>This publication does not attempt to
describe the scenic beauty of Palo Duro
Canyon, for this must be seen to be appreciated.
Rather, it discusses the geologic setting and origin of the canyon, the
methods by which some of the more interesting
geologic features were formed, and
briefly reviews the history of the area.
Hopefully, it will enable the visitor to
understand better the meaning behind the
canyon scenery, thereby enhancing his
visit.</p>

<h2 id="c3">PARK HISTORY</h2>
<p>Palo Duro Canyon&rsquo;s long and colorful
past has created considerable interest
among historians, archeologists, and geologists.
Historians have traced the written
history of man and his effect on the Palo
Duro area, but archeologists have delved
much further into the past. They have
sought out and studied the more enduring
records of the canyon&rsquo;s early inhabitants&mdash;their
tools, utensils, and weapons. The
geologist, however, is interested in history
that far antedates even the most primitive
human inhabitant of the canyon. The earth
scientist has probed the geologic record of
the Palo Duro area, using <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mineral">minerals</a>,
and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossils</a> as clues to the geologic history
and development of the canyon.</p>
<p>Palo Duro Canyon is unique among
Texas&rsquo; State parks because of its many
contributions to history, archeology, and
geology. Here the written record, the artifacts
of prehistoric man, and the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">geologic formations</a> overlap and complement each
other in many respects. Although this
guidebook is primarily concerned with the
geologic history of the canyon, a brief review
of its human history is also included.</p>
<h3 id="c4">ANCIENT MAN IN PALO DURO CANYON</h3>
<p>Archeological studies indicate that the
earliest known inhabitants of Palo Duro
Canyon lived in the canyon from about
10,000 to 5,000 B.C. These early men apparently
hunted the bison and now-extinct
elephant-like mammoths that roamed the
Palo Duro area during the <a class="gloss" href="#g_IceAge">Ice Age</a> of
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> time (<i>see</i> <a class="gloss" href="#g_GeologicTimeScale">geologic time scale</a>,
<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>). Their stone weapons and other
artifacts have been found in and around
the canyon. It is assumed that these primitive
people&mdash;like those who came later&mdash;were
attracted by the streams and springs
that are found in the canyon and by game
that came there to feed. There is also evidence
that the Indians took advantage of
certain of the canyon&rsquo;s geologic features.
They fashioned tools, weapons, and utensils
from the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> exposed in the canyon and
used certain of the shallow caves and rock
shelters as their homes.</p>
<h3 id="c5">INDIANS OF THE PLAINS</h3>
<p>Various tribes of Plains Indians of historic
times also used Palo Duro Canyon as
a camping ground. The presence of these
Indians is known from many campsites
and burials. In addition, flint chips and
stone artifacts, potsherds, ornaments of
shell and bone, grinding slabs, stone mortars
(<a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>), and a few pictographs (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>)
have provided considerable information
about the culture of these people.
Among the tribes believed to have frequented
the canyon at various times are the
Apaches, Cheyennes, Arapahos, Kiowas,
and Comanches. However, it is the Comanches
who are most closely associated
with the Palo Duro area, for the canyon is
located near the center of their last homeland.
Indeed it was here that the Comanches
were finally defeated and driven from
this part of the Plains. The battlefield
where Colonel Ranald Mackenzie&rsquo;s troops
fought the Comanches is located near the
southeast corner of the park (<i>see</i> <a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>).
This skirmish, which took place in 1874, is
believed to have been the last major Indian
battle in Texas.</p>
<p>Although most of the canyon&rsquo;s archeological
sites have been picked over and
many of the artifacts removed, important
finds are still occasionally reported. Park
visitors who make discoveries of this type
are urged to report them to a park ranger
in order that they might be called to the
attention of the proper authorities.</p>
<h3 id="c6">ADVENT OF THE WHITE MAN</h3>
<p>Although the history of Palo Duro Canyon
is rich in Indian lore, it was the coming
of the white man that heralded the
development of the area. Today it is generally
believed that Francisco Vasquez de
Coronado was the first white man to view
the canyon. Coronado and his men are
thought to have camped here during the
winter of 1541, as they crossed the High
Plains in search of the fabled Seven Cities
of Cibola.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 2. Place map of Palo Duro Canyon.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Later, during the 17th and 18th centuries,
the canyon was a favorite resting
place of the buffalo hunters and Indian
traders who frequented the Plains. The
canyon was also popular during the first
half of the 19th century, for it was then
that it was occupied by the Comanches and
served as a trade center for the Spaniards
and Indians who came from New Mexico.
These traders, called <i>comancheros</i>, bartered
for loot taken by the Comanches on
their raids of early settlements and wagon
trains that passed through the Panhandle-Plains
region.</p>
<p>This same <a class="gloss" href="#g_Era">era</a> marked the beginning of
American interest in the Palo Duro country.
During this <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a> the area was visited
by several expeditions including those of
Long and Pike and the Texas-Santa Fe
Expedition of 1841. However, the canyon
was not fully explored or mapped until
1852. This important survey was carried
out by a party which was under the supervision
of Captain R. B. Marcy.</p>
<p>But it was not until 1876 that the first
white man established permanent residence
in Palo Duro Canyon. In 1876&mdash;just
two years after McKenzie&rsquo;s rout of the
Comanches&mdash;Colonel Charles Goodnight
herded more than 1,600 head of cattle into
the canyon. Here he laid out his first permanent
ranch and lived in a primitive
earthen dugout. Not only was Goodnight&rsquo;s
Palo Duro Ranch the first in the canyon,
it is also thought to have been the first
commercial cattle ranch in the Texas Panhandle.
In later years Colonel Goodnight
formed a partnership with John Adair of
Ireland, and together they developed the
famous JA Ranch&mdash;a vast spread of some
600,000 acres. Today&rsquo;s visitor to Palo Duro
Canyon can visit a partially restored dugout
similar to that occupied by the canyon&rsquo;s
early settlers (<a href="#fig30">fig. 30</a>).</p>

<p>From the late 1800s until about 1930,
the Palo Duro country remained the domain
of the Panhandle-Plains cattleman.
It was, nonetheless, a favorite picnic and
camping spot of the residents of nearby
towns and cities. In 1933 the recreational
potential of the canyon was finally recognized
and land for the Palo Duro Canyon
State Park was purchased by the State of
Texas with money obtained through a public
revenue bond issue. Today, most of the
park revenue received through gate admissions,
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
concession receipts, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mineral">mineral</a>
leases goes into a fund that pays off the
remaining balance of the revenue bonds.
During the initial phase of the park&rsquo;s development,
most of the improvements in
the area were made by members of the
Civilian Conservation Corps who worked
under the supervision of the National Park
Service.</p>
<p>Currently, Palo Duro Canyon State
Park is visited by approximately 300,000
visitors each year and is one of the State&rsquo;s
more popular recreational and scenic areas.</p>
<h2 id="c7">REGIONAL SETTING</h2>
<p>Palo Duro Canyon State Park is located
in the Panhandle of Texas (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>) approximately
13 miles east of Canyon on State
Highway 217 (<i>see</i> <a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>). It is about 12
miles south and 8 miles east of Amarillo
via Ranch Road 1541 which intersects
State Highway 217. The park includes
more than 15,000 acres of Palo Duro Canyon,
a complexly dissected area which
spreads into Randall, Armstrong, and Briscoe
counties.</p>
<p>More specifically, the Palo Duro area is
situated on the Llano Estacado or High
Plains area which comprises approximately
20,000 square miles of Texas and New
Mexico (<i>see</i> <a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>). Generally speaking,
the Llano Estacado is a high isolated plateau
or broad mesa, rising above the surrounding
rolling plains in a nearly flat,
island-like mass. On the west, southwest,
and south, the Llano Estacado is bounded
by the valley of the Pecos River, while its
eastern escarpment is drained by the headwaters
of the Red, Brazos, and Colorado
Rivers.</p>
<p>The rim of Palo Duro Canyon is formed
by the Eastern Caprock Escarpment. Caprock
is the term used to describe a massive
layer of calcareous <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> which supports the
High Plains surface (<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_26">p. 26</a>). Because it
is more resistant to forces of erosion than
the softer, underlying more or less horizontal
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Stratum">strata</a>, the caprock forms an abrupt,
precipitous escarpment at the edge of the
High Plains. With the exception of the
resistant caprock, however, the surficial deposits
on the High Plains are for the most
part unconsolidated <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sediment">sediments</a>.</p>
<p>The Llano Estacado is essentially devoid
of native trees and is characterized by a
sparse, but uniform, covering of grasses.
The surface <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> are of Tertiary and
Quaternary age (<i>see</i> <a class="gloss" href="#g_GeologicTimeScale">geologic time scale</a>,
<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>) and have a general easterly to
southeasterly slope of about 9&frac12; feet per
mile. In the vicinity of Palo Duro Canyon,
rocks of Late <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> age are directly
underlain by <a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a> and Triassic <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">formations</a>.
These Permian and Triassic rocks,
which are discussed elsewhere in this publication,
are not normally exposed except in
deeply eroded areas such as the canyon.</p>

<h2 id="c8">THE GEOLOGIC STORY</h2>
<h3 id="c9">THE CANYON&rsquo;S <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">ROCKS</a> AND <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mineral">MINERALS</a></h3>
<p>Palo Duro visitors&mdash;regardless of age&mdash;seem
to have an innate curiosity about the
canyon&rsquo;s <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a>. This is not surprising, for
most of the features of the park landscape
are composed of or have been sculptured
from solid rock. In short, much of the natural
beauty of Palo Duro Canyon has been
derived from the character of its exposed
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">rock formations</a> and the effect of geologic agents upon them.</p>
<p>Because <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> are the raw materials of
geology and the stuff from which landscapes
are formed, it will be helpful for the
visitor to know something about the general
characteristics of rocks and their role
in the development of the landscape. Rock
is everywhere around us and is one of the
most common objects in the world, yet few
people can actually define a rock. So, at
the outset it should be stated that <i>a rock is
a naturally formed aggregate of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mineral">minerals</a></i>,
and <i>a mineral is a naturally occurring substance
which has a fairly definite chemical
composition, distinctive physical properties,
characteristic internal structure, and
which commonly occurs in definite shapes
called crystals</i>. Although not an exact scientific
or legal definition of a mineral, the
above explanation is satisfactory for the
purposes of this publication.</p>
<p>Although most visitors show considerable
interest in the canyon&rsquo;s <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mineral">minerals</a>,
few of them know the story behind
the rocks. They do not know how the rocks
were formed, of what they are composed,
how they change, and how they differ.
More important, they fail to realize the
historical significance of the rocks and
how they can be used to interpret events
that occurred in the canyon many millions
of years ago. Thus, before one studies the
geologic story of Palo Duro Canyon, it is
helpful to know something about the various
kinds of rocks. There are three major
classes of rocks in the earth&rsquo;s crust: <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_IgneousRock">igneous</a></i>,
<i><a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRock">sedimentary</a></i>, and <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_MetamorphicRock">metamorphic rocks</a></i>.</p>
<p><i><a class="gloss" href="#g_IgneousRock">Igneous rocks</a></i> solidified from an original
molten state. Common examples of igneous rocks include granite, basalt, and volcanic
ash. Although no igneous rocks are found
in Palo Duro Canyon, they are widely exposed
in parts of West and Central Texas.</p>
<p><i><a class="gloss" href="#g_MetamorphicRock">Metamorphic rocks</a></i> were originally <a class="gloss" href="#g_IgneousRock">igneous</a> or <a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRock">sedimentary</a> in origin. However,
these <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> have undergone such great
physical and chemical change that they
have been transformed into a different
kind of rock. Thus, metamorphic changes
alter limestone to marble or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandstone">sandstone</a> to
quartzite. No metamorphic rocks crop out
in the canyon, but, like the igneous rocks,
they are common in some parts of the
State.</p>
<p>All of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">geologic formations</a> exposed
in Palo Duro Canyon are composed of
<i><a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRock">sedimentary rocks</a></i>. These are <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> that
have been formed by the compaction and
cementation of rock and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mineral">mineral</a> fragments
called <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Sediment">sediments</a></i>, or by the precipitation
of material from solution. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandstone">Sandstone</a>,
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Conglomerate">conglomerate</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shale">shale</a>, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Caliche">caliche</a>
(<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_26">p. 26</a>) are examples of sedimentary rocks that are exposed in the canyon.</p>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRock">Sedimentary rocks</a> are typically <i>stratified</i>,
that is, they occur in layers or beds
called <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Stratum">strata</a></i>. In addition, sedimentary rocks&mdash;especially those of marine origin&mdash;commonly
contain <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossils</a></i>. These fossils are
traces or evidence of prehistoric plants and
animals that have been preserved in the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a>, and they may provide clues as to
the age of rocks and the manner in which
they were formed. Fossil remains have
been found at a number of places in the
park and these are discussed later.</p>
<h3 id="c10">UNRAVELING EARTH HISTORY</h3>
<p>In order to understand better the geologic history and development of the canyon,
one should also have some knowledge
of the basic principles of earth history and
should be familiar with the <a class="gloss" href="#g_GeologicTimeScale">geologic time scale</a> (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>).</p>

<p>The geologist has learned that the earth&rsquo;s
physical features have not always been as
they are today. It is known, for example,
that mountains now occupy the sites of
ancient seas. Coal is now being mined
where swamps existed many millions of
years ago. Furthermore, the earth&rsquo;s plants
and animals have also been subject to
great change. The trend of this organic
change is, in general, toward more complex
and advanced forms of life. However, some
forms have remained virtually unaltered
while others have become extinct at different
points in <a class="gloss" href="#g_GeologicTime">geologic time</a>.</p>
<p>In order to interpret earth history, the
earth scientist gathers evidence of the
great changes in climate, geography, and
life that took place in the geologic past. He
does this by studying the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">rock formations</a>,
the structural relationships of these formations,
and the landforms of the area. The
record of ancient events is pieced together
by studying the stony layers of the earth as
one might study a giant history book. Indeed,
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRock">sedimentary rocks</a> are the rocky
&ldquo;pages&rdquo; of earth history, for in them we
find the tracks and trails, and bones and
stones, which reveal the intriguing story of
life long ago.</p>
<p>Much of the basic information which
the geologist uses to reconstruct the geologic history of a region comes from his
examination and interpretation of <i>bedrock
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Outcrop">outcrops</a></i>. <i>Bedrock</i> is the solid unweathered
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> which underlies loose earth material
such as soil, sand, and gravel. An <i>outcrop</i>,
or <i>exposure</i>, is a place where bedrock is
exposed at the surface.</p>
<p>The first chapter of earth history begins
with the most ancient <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> known. Because
they were formed early in <a class="gloss" href="#g_GeologicTime">geologic time</a>, these rocks are normally found deeply
buried beneath younger rocks which
have been deposited on top of them. It is
for this reason that earth history is read
from the bottom up, for the earliest formed
rock layers correspond to the opening
chapter in our earthen history book. The
later chapters are found in the upper
younger rocks which are located nearer
the surface. Thus, in &ldquo;reading&rdquo; the geologic history of Palo Duro Canyon we start
with the oldest &ldquo;chapter&rdquo; which is recorded
in the Quartermaster <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formation</a> (<a href="#Page_17">p. 17</a>)
of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a> age, for these are the oldest
rocks exposed in the canyon.</p>
<p>But deciphering earth history is not as
simple as it might appear. In many areas
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> layers are not always found in the
sequence in which they were originally
deposited. In places, great structural disturbances
have caused some of the rocky
&ldquo;pages&rdquo; to become shuffled and out of
place; others may be missing completely.
Many rocks have been destroyed by <a class="gloss" href="#g_Weathering">weathering</a>
and erosion or greatly altered by
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Metamorphism">metamorphism</a>. As a result, the story recorded
in these particular rocks is lost forever.
These missing &ldquo;pages&rdquo; make the ancient
story even more difficult to interpret
so the geologist must then depend on other
evidence that will permit him to &ldquo;fill in the
blanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The record revealed in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> indicates
that our planet is at least 4&frac12; billion
years old and that life has been present for
more than 3 billion years. During this vast
span of time the earth and its inhabitants
have undergone many changes.</p>
<h3 id="c11">THE GEOLOGIC COLUMN AND <a class="gloss" href="#g_GeologicTime">GEOLOGIC TIME</a> SCALE</h3>
<p>The <i>geologic column</i> refers to the total
succession of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a>, from the oldest to the
most recent, that are found in the entire
earth or in a given area. For example, the
geologic column of Texas includes all rock
divisions known to be present in the State.
By the same token, the geologic column of
Palo Duro Canyon consists of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">geologic formations</a> exposed there. Thus, by referring
to the geologic column previously determined
for a specific area, the geologist
can determine what type of rock he might
expect to find in that particular region.</p>
<p>The <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_GeologicTimeScale">geologic time scale</a></i> (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>) is composed
of named intervals of <a class="gloss" href="#g_GeologicTime">geologic time</a> during which were deposited the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> of
the geologic column. These time intervals
bear the same names that are used to distinguish
the various units of the geologic column. For example, one can speak of
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a> <i>time</i> (referring to the geologic time scale) or of Permian <i>rocks</i> (referring
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
to rock units of Permian age in the geologic column).</p>
<p>Both the geologic column and the <a class="gloss" href="#g_GeologicTimeScale">geologic time scale</a> are based upon the <i>principle
of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Superposition">superposition</a></i>. This basic geologic concept states that unless a series of <a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRock">sedimentary rock</a> has been overturned, a given
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> layer is older than the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stratum">strata</a> above it,
and younger than all of the layers below it.
Thus, the field relationship of the rocks
plus the type of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossils</a> (if present) give
the geologist some indication of the <i>relative</i>
age of the rocks. Relative age does not
imply age in years; rather, it fixes age in
relation to other events that are recorded
in the rocks.</p>
<p>Within recent years, however, it has become
possible to assign ages in years to
certain <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> units. This is accomplished by
a system of rock dating based on very precise
measurements of amounts of radioactive
elements (such as uranium). When
present in the rocks, radioactive <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mineral">minerals</a>
change or decay at a known rate so that
they are natural &ldquo;clocks.&rdquo; This method of
dating has made it possible to devise a time
scale in years which gives some idea of the
tremendous amount of time that has passed
since the oldest known rocks were formed.
It has also been used to verify the previously
determined relative ages of the various
rock units.</p>
<p>The largest unit of <a class="gloss" href="#g_GeologicTime">geologic time</a> is an
<i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Era">era</a></i>, and each era is divided into smaller
time units called <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">periods</a></i>. A period of geologic time is divided into <i>epochs</i>, which, in
turn, may be subdivided into still smaller
units. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_GeologicTimeScale">geologic time scale</a> might be
roughly compared to the calendar in which
the year is divided into months, months
into weeks, and weeks into days. Unlike
years, however, geologic time units are
arbitrary and of unequal duration, and the
geologist cannot be positive about the exact
length of time involved in each unit. The
time scale does, however, provide a standard
by which he can discuss the age of
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossils</a> and their surrounding <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a>. By
referring to the time scale it may be possible,
for instance, to state that a certain
event occurred during the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> Era
in the same sense that one might say that
something happened during the American
Revolution.</p>
<p>There are five eras of <a class="gloss" href="#g_GeologicTime">geologic time</a>, and
each has been given a name that is descriptive
of the degree of life development that
characterizes that <a class="gloss" href="#g_Era">era</a>. Hence, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a>
means &ldquo;ancient-life&rdquo; and the era was so
named because of the relatively simple and
ancient stage of life development.</p>
<p>The eras, a guide to their pronunciation,
and the literal translation of each
name is shown below.</p>
<dl class="undent"><dd><a class="gloss" href="#g_Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> (SEE-no-zo-ic)&mdash;&ldquo;recent-life&rdquo;</dd>
<dd><a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> (MES-o-zo-ic)&mdash;&ldquo;middle-life&rdquo;</dd>
<dd><a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> (PAY-lee-o-zo-ic)&mdash;&ldquo;ancient-life&rdquo;</dd>
<dd><a class="gloss" href="#g_Proterozoic">Proterozoic</a> (PRO-ter-o-zo-ic)&mdash;&ldquo;earlier-life&rdquo;</dd>
<dd><a class="gloss" href="#g_Archeozoic">Archeozoic</a> (AR-kee-o-zo-ic)&mdash;&ldquo;beginning-life&rdquo;</dd></dl>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Archeozoic">Archeozoic</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Proterozoic">Proterozoic</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> are
commonly grouped together and referred
to as Precambrian in age. In most places
Precambrian rocks have been greatly contorted
and metamorphosed, and the record
of this portion of earth history is most
difficult to interpret. Precambrian time
represents that portion of <a class="gloss" href="#g_GeologicTime">geologic time</a> from the beginning of earth history until
the deposition of the earliest fossiliferous
Cambrian <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stratum">strata</a>. Precambrian time probably
represents as much as 85 percent of
all geologic time.</p>
<p>The <i>oldest</i> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Era">era</a> is at the <i>bottom</i> of the
time scale because this part of <a class="gloss" href="#g_GeologicTime">geologic time</a> transpired first and was then followed
by the successively younger eras which are
placed above it. This is, of course, the order
in which the various portions of geologic time occurred and during which the corresponding
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> were formed.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, each of the eras
has been divided into <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">periods</a>, and most of
these periods derive their names from the
regions in which the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> of each were
first studied. For example, the Pennsylvanian
rocks of North America were first
studied in the State of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Era">Era</a> has been divided into
seven <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">periods</a> of geologic time. With the
oldest at the bottom of the list, these
periods and the source of their names are:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dd><a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a> (PUR-me-un)&mdash;from the Province of Perm in Russia</dd>
<dd>Pennsylvanian (pen-sil-VAIN-yun)&mdash;from the State of Pennsylvania</dd>

<dd>Ordovician (or-doe-VISH-un)&mdash;for the Ordovices, an ancient tribe of Britain</dd>
<dd>Cambrian (KAM-bri-un)&mdash;from the Latin word <i>Cambria</i>, meaning Wales</dd></dl>
<p>The Carboniferous <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">Period</a> in Europe includes
the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian
Periods of North America. Although
this classification is no longer used in the
United States, the term Carboniferous is
found in many of the earlier geological
publications and on many of the earlier
geologic maps.</p>
<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">periods</a> of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Era">Era</a> and the
source of their names are:</p>

<dd>Jurassic (joo-RAS-ik)&mdash;from the Jura Mountains of Europe</dd>

<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">periods</a> derived their
names from an old outdated system of
classification which divided all of the
earth&rsquo;s <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> into four groups. The two
divisions listed below are the only names
of this system which are still in use:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dd>Quaternary (kwah-TUR-nuh-ri)</dd>
<dd>Tertiary (TUR-shi-ri)</dd></dl>
<p>Although the units named above are the
major divisions of <a class="gloss" href="#g_GeologicTime">geologic time</a> and of the
geologic column, the geologist generally
works with smaller units of the column
called <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">geologic formations</a></i>. A geologic formation
is a unit of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> that is recognized
by certain physical and chemical characteristics.
A formation is generally given a
double name which indicates both where
it is exposed and the type of rock that makes
up the bulk of the formation. For example,
the Beaumont Clay is a formation consisting
of clay deposits that are found in and
around Beaumont, Texas. For convenience
in study, two or more successive and adjoining
formations may be placed together
in a group. Thus, the Tecovas and Trujillo
Formations have been placed in the Dockum
Group. Likewise, a formation may be
subdivided into smaller units such as members,
which may also be given geographic
or lithologic (rock type) names.</p>
<h3 id="c12"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">GEOLOGIC FORMATIONS</a> EXPOSED IN PALO DURO CANYON</h3>
<p>As noted above, all of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> which
crop out in Palo Duro Canyon are <a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRock">sedimentary</a> in origin. They represent four
different geological <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">periods</a>: the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a>,
Triassic, Tertiary, and Quaternary (<a href="#fig12">fig. 12</a>).</p>
<p>Although these <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">rock formations</a> differ
considerably in composition and age, they
do not tell the whole geologic story of the
area. Long spans of <a class="gloss" href="#g_GeologicTime">geologic time</a> are not
represented by <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> units because the
region was undergoing erosion or no <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sediment">sediments</a>
were being deposited during certain
portions of geologic time. Rocks that had
formed during one geologic <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a> were
removed by erosion during a later period.
Thus, segments of the geologic record were
destroyed or never recorded. For this
reason, much of the geologic history of the
Palo Duro area is unrecorded and must be
inferred from fragmentary evidence borrowed
and pieced together from adjacent
areas. Even so, an interesting story can be
assembled from the rocks that remain in
the canyon today.</p>
<p>In general, the following descriptions of
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">formations</a> exposed in Palo Duro
Canyon State Park follow the procedure
that most geologists use in presenting the
results of their geologic investigations. The
more distinctive characteristics of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a>
units are described in order that they may
be more easily recognized, and the ways in
which the rocks were formed are also considered.
With this background it is then
possible to review the geologic history
recorded in the bedrock of the canyon. A
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
simplified geologic map is presented in
<a href="#fig7">figure 7</a>; this shows the distribution of the
major rock types in the canyon. The reader
will find it helpful to refer to this map
when reading the descriptions of the various
formations.</p>
<h4 id="c13">Quartermaster <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formation</a>.&mdash;</h4>
<p>The oldest
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">formation</a> exposed in the canyon is the
Quartermaster Formation of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a> age
(<i>see</i> <a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>) which is named from exposures
along the banks of Quartermaster
Creek in Roger Mills County, Oklahoma.
One of the more colorful formations in the
park, the Quartermaster is composed primarily
of brick-red to vermilion <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shale">shales</a>
which are interbedded with lenses of gray
shales, clays, mudstones, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandstone">sandstones</a>.
Averaging about 60 feet thick where exposed
in the park, the Quartermaster forms
the floor and lower walls of the canyon.</p>
<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> of this <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">formation</a> are easily
examined at many places throughout the
canyon and in them can be seen a number
of interesting geologic phenomena. Probably
the most noticeable of these features
are the shining white veins of <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Gypsum">gypsum</a></i> that
lace the face of the red <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shale">shale</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Outcrop">outcrops</a>
(<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>). A soft, transparent to translucent
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Mineral">mineral</a> that can be scratched by a fingernail,
gypsum is hydrous calcium sulfate
(CaSO&#8324;&middot;2H&#8322;O). Three varieties of gypsum
are found in the canyon: (1) <i>satin spar</i>, a
fibrous variety with a silky sheen; (2)
<i>selenite</i>, a colorless, transparent variety
which commonly occurs in sheet-like
masses; and (3) a fine-grained massive
variety called <i>alabaster</i>. Satin spar is the
most common variety of gypsum present
and it commonly occurs in thin bands interbedded
with the mudstones and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandstone">sandstones</a>.
It is much more noticeable in the
shales, however, for it is typically seen in
narrow veins which criss-cross the surface
of the outcrop and intersect the <a class="gloss" href="#g_BeddingPlane">bedding planes</a> at various angles. Although normally
white, some of the satin spar has a
soft pink or bluish hue due to the presence
of impurities in the mineral.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The presence of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Gypsum">gypsum</a> in the Quartermaster
<a class="gloss" href="#g_RedBeds">red beds</a> is of special significance
to the geologist, for it provides valuable
information about the geologic history of
the Palo Duro area. It is known, for example,
that when a landlocked body of sea
water in an arid climate becomes separated
from the ocean, one of the most common
salts to precipitate is hydrous calcium sulfate,
or gypsum. Gypsum may also be precipitated
when a lake without an outlet
evaporates in an arid climate. Geologic evidence suggests that the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sediment">sediments</a> which
gave rise to the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> of the Quartermaster
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formation</a> were deposited in a landlocked
arm of the sea during the latter part of the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">Period</a>. As evaporation continued
and the sea water was reduced to approximately
one-third of its original volume,
gypsum was precipitated. There must have
been periodic influxes of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Silt">silt</a>- and mud-bearing
waters entering the ancient Permian
sea, for layers of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shale">shale</a> and mudstone
are interbedded with the gypsum.</p>
<p>It is believed that much of the satin spar
and selenite <a class="gloss" href="#g_Gypsum">gypsum</a> was originally <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Anhydrite">anhydrite</a></i>
(CaSO&#8324;). Unlike gypsum, anhydrite
does not contain water, but it can be
changed to gypsum in the presence of
moisture. There are two lines of evidence
that indicate an anhydrite origin for the
Quartermaster gypsum. First, microscopic
examination of gypsum samples reveals the
presence of residual anhydrite crystals embedded
in the gypsum. Second, many of
the gypsum beds have been squeezed into
rather gentle <i>folds</i>. These consist of small
<i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Anticline">anticlines</a></i>, upfolds or arches, and <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Syncline">synclines</a></i>,
downfolds or troughs (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>). It has been
suggested that this folding took place as the
anhydrite underwent <i>hydration</i>, or took on
water. As hydration occurred and the anhydrite
was converted to gypsum, the gypsum
expanded, thereby exerting both
lateral and vertical pressure on the beds
around it. This produced the crumpled,
wave-like folding so characteristic of
certain of the gypsum beds. However,
there is not complete agreement that the
folding in the gypsum is due to the hydration
of anhydrite. Certain geologists attribute
this deformation to slumping caused
by solution cavities, for gypsum is relatively
easily dissolved in water. As the gypsum
was dissolved and carried away in solution,
the removal of the supporting layers of
gypsum permitted slumping and consequent
deformation in the overlying <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shale">shales</a>
and mudstones. Although some geologists
believe that the folds were caused by expansion
due to the hydration of anhydrite
and others support deformation related to
the removal of soluble gypsum, there is
general agreement that the folding is local
and not related to regional or widespread
deformation.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Not all of the red Quartermaster <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shale">shales</a>
are uniformly colored. Some of them contain
gray-green, circular spots called <i>reduction
halos</i> (<a href="#fig10">fig. 10</a>). These spots, which in
places give the red shales a distinctive
polka-dot appearance, have been produced
as the result of chemical change of certain
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Mineral">minerals</a> within the shale.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sediment">sediments</a> are usually
laid down in horizontal layers. However,
in certain environments, sediments may
be deposited in such a way that the layers
are inclined at angle to horizontal (<a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>).
This structure, called <i>cross-bedding</i>
or <i>cross-stratification</i>, is found in certain
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandstone">sandstones</a> and other coarse-grained or
fragmental <a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRock">sedimentary rocks</a>. Cross-bedding typically consists of rather distinct
inclined layers separated by <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_BeddingPlane">bedding planes</a></i> (the surface of demarcation between
two individual <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> layers). Bedding of this type commonly occurs in sedimentary rocks formed in rivers, deltas,
and along the margins of lakes or oceans.
The cross-bedding in the Quartermaster
and certain of the Triassic <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">formations</a> is
believed to have been developed under
similar conditions. Although cross-bedding is also common in certain rocks of <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Eolian">eolian</a></i>
origin (deposited by wind) none of the
cross-bedding in the canyon&rsquo;s rocks is due
to the action of wind.</p>
<p>In addition, some of the Quartermaster
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Stratum">strata</a> have <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_RippleMarks">ripple marks</a></i> on their surfaces.
These features are common in certain <a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRock">sedimentary rocks</a> and were formed when the
surface of a bed of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sediment">sediment</a> was agitated
by waves or currents. The size, shape, and
cross section of the ripple marks can be
used to tell whether the marks were produced
by waves or currents. The ripple marks in the Quartermaster appear to have
been formed by the action of waves on a
shallow sea floor.</p>
<p>A number of interesting geologic features
in the canyon have been formed in
part in the Quartermaster <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formation</a>.
These include the multi-hued Spanish
Skirts (<a href="#fig26">fig. 26</a>), the Devil&rsquo;s Slide (<a href="#fig35">fig. 35</a>),
Capitol Peak (<a href="#fig32">fig. 32</a>), and Catarina Cave
(<a href="#fig27">fig. 27</a>). The latter is a rather unusual
cave in that it has developed in a large
mass of landslide debris divided by projecting
bedrock of the Spanish Skirts. The
cave has been formed by <i>suffosian</i>, a process
whereby water enters the landslide
debris on the upper slopes and follows
buried channels in the landslide removing
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> debris as it passes through. The flood
water exits at the base of the landslide by
means of Catarina Cave. The plan of the
cave closely resembles the drainage patterns
of surface gullies.</p>
<h4 id="c14">Tecovas <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formation</a>.&mdash;</h4>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">Rocks</a> of the Triassic
System (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>) are well represented
in Palo Duro Canyon and consist of the
<i>Tecovas</i> and <i>Trujillo</i> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formations</a>. These
formations are part of the Dockum Group
of Late Triassic age.</p>
<p>Having a total thickness of about 200
feet, the Tecovas (which is named from
exposures found on Tecovas Creek in Potter
County, Texas) consists largely of
multicolored <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shale">shales</a>. Also present are thin
layers of soft <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandstone">sandstone</a>, which are disseminated
throughout the shales, and a
more prominent bed of white sandstone,
which marks the middle of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">formation</a>.
The Tecovas shales overlie the Quartermaster
Formation, and the lower zone of
lavender, gray, and white shales forms a
relatively smooth slope that is easily distinguished
from the steeper slopes of gullied
red-and-white-banded shales beneath
them (<a href="#fig12">fig. 12</a>).</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>But the contact zone between the Tecovas
and Quartermaster <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shale">shales</a> involves
more than a mere change in color. Here is
one of the missing &ldquo;chapters&rdquo; in the geologic history of the canyon, for part of the
Late <a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a> record and all of the record
of Early and Middle Triassic time are
missing from the geologic column. Such
gaps in the column are represented by
<i>unconformities</i> in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a>. Here the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Unconformity">unconformity</a>
is an ancient erosional surface
between the Tecovas <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formation</a> of Late
Triassic age and the Late Permian Quartermaster
Formation, and there are many millions
of years of earth history represented
in this missing &ldquo;chapter&rdquo; in the geologic story of Palo Duro Canyon. During this
vast span of time, thousands of feet of
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Sediment">sediments</a> were probably deposited, converted
into rock, and then later removed by
erosion.</p>
<p>Near the middle of the Tecovas <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formation</a>
there is a bed of white, crumbly (friable)
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandstone">sandstone</a>. Averaging about 15 feet
in thickness, this sandstone contains many
<i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Joint">joints</a></i> (small crack-like fractures) along
which no appreciable movement has taken
place (<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>). There are two distinct sets
of these joints which intersect each other at
right angles. The distinctive joint patterns,
the color, and the friability of this sandstone
clearly differentiate it from the harder,
darker, and more coarse-grained sandstones
of the overlying Trujillo Formation
(<a href="#Page_22">p. 22</a>).</p>
<p>The upper part of the Tecovas consists
of a layer of orange <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shale">shale</a> which overlies
the middle <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandstone">sandstone</a> unit and is in contact
with the lower part of the Trujillo <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formation</a>.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">
<img src="images/pmg013b.jpg" alt="" width="703" height="500" />
<p class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 12.</span> Taken from the northwest rim near Coronado Lodge, this photograph shows the four major
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> units exposed in the park: (1) The Quartermaster <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formation</a> which forms the lower wall and
canyon floor; (2) Tecovas Formation; (3) Trujillo Formation which caps the mesas; and (4)
Ogallala Formation.</p>
</div>
<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossils</a> which have been found in the
Tecovas <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formation</a> suggest that these <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a>
were derived from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sediment">sediments</a> deposited in
swamps and streams. Unlike the <i>marine</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
deposits of the Quartermaster, the rocks of
the Tecovas were formed from <i>continental</i>
deposits laid down on the land. Fossils
found in the canyon include the bones and
teeth of the extinct semi-aquatic reptiles
known as <i>phytosaurs</i> (<a href="#fig13">fig. 13</a>) and bone
and skull fragments of a primitive amphibian
called <i>Buettneria</i> (<a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>). <i>Coprolites</i>
(the fossilized excrement of animals),
pieces of petrified wood, and the
teeth and bones of lungfish have also been
reported from the Tecovas.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">

<p class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 13.</span> The skull of this crocodile-like creature called a phytosaur is typical of the reptiles that
inhabited the Palo Duro area during the Triassic <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">Period</a>. (Photograph courtesy Panhandle-Plains
Historical Museum.)</p>
</div>
<p>A number of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mineral">minerals</a> including <i>hematite</i>,
an iron mineral, and <i>psilomelane</i>, a
barium-magnesium oxide, occur in the
Tecovas. Hematite is an ore of iron and
psilomelane a manganese ore, though neither
of these is present in commercial quantities
in the canyon.</p>
<p>The Tecovas also contains a number of
<i>concretions</i> which range from a fraction of
an inch to as much as 6 inches in diameter.
These spherical masses are generally harder
than the fine-grained shaly sands in
which they are found and were thus left
behind when the surrounding <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> was
eroded away. Some of these concretions
are marked by cracks or veins filled with
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mineral">mineral</a> <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcite">calcite</a></i>. Concretions bearing
this type of structure are called <i>septaria</i>,
or <i>septarian concretions</i>.</p>
<p><i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Geode">Geodes</a></i> are also found in the Tecovas
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formation</a>. These are rounded concretionary
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> with a hollow interior that is
frequently lined with <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mineral">mineral</a> crystals.
Well-formed crystals of clear <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcite">calcite</a> have
been found in many of the geodes from
the Tecovas.</p>
<p>Among park landmarks that are characterized
by the multi-hued Tecovas <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stratum">strata</a>
are the middle portion of Triassic Peak
(<a href="#fig25">fig. 25</a>), the upper part of the Spanish
Skirts (<a href="#fig26">fig. 26</a>), Capitol Peak (<a href="#fig32">fig. 32</a>),
and the Devil&rsquo;s Slide (<a href="#fig35">fig. 35</a>).</p>
<h4 id="c15">Trujillo <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formation</a>.&mdash;</h4>
<p>Named from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a>
exposures on Trujillo Creek in Oldham
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
County, Texas, the Trujillo is easy to distinguish
from the underlying Tecovas
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formation</a>. The contact is quite distinct
and lies between the top of the orange
Tecovas <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shale">shale</a> and the base of the massive-bedded,
cliff-forming Trujillo <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandstone">sandstone</a>
(<a href="#fig25">fig. 25</a>). Although generally fine grained
and thickly bedded, there are local concentrations
of pebble-sized rock fragments in
the Trujillo. The weathered surface of the
lower sandstone is stained red or dark
brown by iron oxides. However, a fresh,
unweathered surface is typically gray or
greenish gray in color, and careful examination
of the unweathered rock reveals the
presence of tiny flakes of mica.</p>
<p>The basal Trujillo <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandstone">sandstone</a> is one of
the most conspicuous <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> units in the canyon
and forms many of the prominent
benches and mesas so typical of the Palo
Duro landscape. In places the sandstone is
cross-bedded (<a href="#Page_20">p. 20</a>) and contains channel
deposits of coarse sand which suggest that
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sediment">sediments</a> from which it was derived
were deposited in ancient stream beds.</p>
<p>Red, maroon, and gray <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shale">shales</a> overlie the
basal <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandstone">sandstone</a> member of the Trujillo,
and these shales are overlain by cross-bedded,
coarse-grained sandstone. Another
interval of varicolored shales separates the
middle sandstone bed from the upper sandstone
member. The middle sandstone unit
is a conspicuous ledge- or cliff-forming
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> and is medium to coarse grained and
commonly cross-bedded. In most localities,
the upper sandstone is overlain by a section
of red and green shales which mark the
uppermost limits of the Trujillo <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formation</a>.
In places, however, this shale section
has been removed by erosion and rocks of
Tertiary age directly overlie the sandstone.</p>
<p>Although <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossils</a> are not common, the
remains of <i>Buettneria</i> (<a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>), leaf imprints,
pieces of mineralized wood, and the
scattered teeth and bone fragments of reptiles
and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Amphibians">amphibians</a> have been found.
Phytosaur remains, especially teeth, have
also been collected from the Trujillo <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandstone">sandstones</a>.</p>
<p>The Indians who formerly inhabited the
Palo Duro area (<a href="#Page_3">p. 3</a>) put the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> of
the canyon to a number of uses. This appears
to be especially true of the rather
coarse-grained Trujillo <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandstone">sandstones</a>, which
were commonly used for constructing
primitive rock shelters. The abrasive surface
of the sandstone was especially well
suited for grinding grain, and mortar holes
have been found in a number of places.
One of these (<a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>) can be seen along
the tracks of the Sad Monkey Railroad
(<a href="#Page_35">p. 35</a>) near the foot of Triassic Peak.
The Indians also used the clays of the
Quartermaster, Tecovas, and Trujillo <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formations</a>
to make pottery, and iron and
copper <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mineral">minerals</a> such as hematite and
malachite were used to make red and green
pigments for decoration and war paint.</p>
<p>The Trujillo <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shale">shales</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandstone">sandstones</a> can
be seen in a number of Palo Duro&rsquo;s more
spectacular geological oddities. These erosional
remnants are best developed where
blocks of erosion-resistant sandstone protect
underlying pedestals of softer shale
(<a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>). This type of differential <a class="gloss" href="#g_Weathering">weathering</a>
(<a href="#Page_31">p. 31</a>) has produced a number of interesting
and unusually shaped pedestal
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> or &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Hoodoo">hoodoos</a>&rdquo; (figs. <a href="#fig16">16</a> and <a href="#fig20">20</a>). The
most spectacular erosional remnant&mdash;and
one that has come to be the &ldquo;trademark&rdquo; of
Palo Duro Canyon&mdash;is the Lighthouse (<a href="#fig31">fig. 31</a>).
The great jumble of boulders called
the Rock Garden (<a href="#fig34">fig. 34</a>) is also composed
largely of massive blocks of dislodged Trujillo
sandstone. These boulders accumulated
on the canyon floor as a result of landslides.
In addition, the rock profile known
as Santana&rsquo;s Face (<a href="#fig28">fig. 28</a>) is a naturally
sculptured profile in the Trujillo sandstone
that forms the cap of Timber Mesa.</p>
<h4 id="c16">Ogallala <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formation</a>.&mdash;</h4>
<p>The Ogallala <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formation</a>
is named from exposures around
Ogallala in Keith County, Nebraska. There
is a major <a class="gloss" href="#g_Unconformity">unconformity</a> between the Trujillo
Formation of the Triassic and the
overlying Ogallala Formation of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pliocene">Pliocene</a>
(Late Tertiary) age. Missing here is the
geologic evidence for what may have been
some of the more exciting chapters in the
canyon&rsquo;s history. There is no record, for
example, of the Jurassic and Cretaceous
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">Periods</a> which together encompass almost
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
120 million years of earth history. Also
missing is any evidence of what transpired
during more than 90 percent of the Tertiary
Period, for no <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> of Paleocene, Eocene,
Oligocene, or Miocene age are exposed
in the canyon. Together these four
epochs comprise approximately 47 million
years of earth history. It is impossible, of
course, to determine how many geologic formations may have been formed and
later eroded during the 167 million years
represented by this unconformity. However,
our knowledge of present-day deposition
and erosion suggests that the missing
geologic record undoubtedly represents
many thousands of feet of rock.</p>

</div>
<p>The lower portion of the Ogallala <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formation</a>
is composed of a reddish-brown,
fine- to medium-grained <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandstone">sandstone</a> that
contrasts sharply with the underlying red and green <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shale">shales</a> that are exposed in the
top of the Trujillo Formation. Much of this
sandy <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> is characterized by pebbles consisting
of a variety of <a class="gloss" href="#g_IgneousRock">igneous</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRock">sedimentary</a>,
and <a class="gloss" href="#g_MetamorphicRock">metamorphic rocks</a>. Because it
consists of rock and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mineral">mineral</a> fragments of
varied composition and size, this kind of
<a class="gloss" href="#g_SedimentaryRock">sedimentary rock</a> is called a <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Conglomerate">conglomerate</a></i>.
The type of rock fragments found in basal
Ogallala conglomerates suggests that they
were transported to the Panhandle-Plains
area by streams flowing southeastward
from the Rocky Mountains. As these
streams deposited their loads, they left behind
a wide spread blanket of sand, gravel,
and mud which formed an extensive alluvial
plain that extended from western Nebraska
to northwest Texas. Although it is
less than 100 feet thick in Palo Duro Canyon,
in places this great mantle of <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_FluvialDeposit">fluvial</a></i>
(stream-deposited) <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sediment">sediments</a> is as much
as 900 feet thick.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Most of the Ogallala <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formation</a> consists
of a mixture of diverse <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> types such as
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Conglomerate">conglomerate</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandstone">sandstone</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Siltstone">siltstone</a>, clay
and marl. But the upper part of the formation
is characterized by thick <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Caliche">caliche</a></i>
deposits. A dull, earthy <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcite">calcite</a> deposit,
caliche typically forms in areas of scant
rainfall. It is believed to originate when
ground moisture, containing dissolved calcium
bicarbonate, moves to the surface
where the moisture steadily evaporates leaving
a calcium carbonate crust on or near
the surface (<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>).</p>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Caliche">Caliche</a>, which derives its name from the
Latin <i>calix</i>, meaning &ldquo;lime,&rdquo; may be firm
and compact or loose and powdery. It is
also commonly found mixed with other
materials such as clay, sand, or gravel. Caliche
commonly occurs in the Trans-Pecos,
southwestern Gulf Coastal Plain, and the
High Plains area of Texas (<i>see</i> <a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>, <a href="#Page_8">p. 8</a>).
In the latter area it typically makes
up the &ldquo;caprock.&rdquo; Caliche is commonly
quarried in these parts of Texas where it
is used as road material and as an aggregate.</p>
<p>Good exposures of Ogallala <a class="gloss" href="#g_Caliche">caliche</a> can
be seen on the surface around the overlook
at Coronado Lodge on the northwest rim of
the canyon (<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>). Ogallala <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stratum">strata</a> also
crop out along the upper reaches of Park
Road 5 as it starts to descend into the canyon.
But probably the most spectacular exposures
of the Ogallala are exposed in the
precipitous face of the Fortress Cliff (<a href="#fig33">fig. 33</a>)
which forms part of the eastern rim of
the canyon.</p>
<p>Also located within the Ogallala <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formation</a>
is a very important <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Aquifer">aquifer</a></i>&mdash;a porous,
water-bearing rock formation. This
fine-to coarse-grained <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandstone">sandstone</a> is very
porous and permeable and is the most important
single water-producing formation
in the Panhandle-Plains area.</p>

</div>
<p>Opal and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chert">chert</a> are locally abundant in
the Ogallala conglomerates. The opal,
which is found in small cavities in the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Conglomerate">conglomerate</a> is not of the gem variety but
it does <i>fluoresce</i>. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mineral">Minerals</a> that exhibit <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Fluorescence">fluorescence</a></i>
emit visible colors when exposed
to ultraviolet light. For this reason, the
Ogallala opal is sought after by <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> and
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
mineral collectors. The chert, a flint-like
variety of quartz, occurs as <a class="gloss" href="#g_Nodule">nodules</a> in the
conglomerate and in a well-developed layer
near the base of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">formation</a>. Both of
these <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Siliceous">siliceous</a></i> (<a class="gloss" href="#g_Silica">silica</a>-bearing) rocks were
apparently prized by the Indians, who used
them to fashion knives, scrapers, projectile
points, and other artifacts. The Indians
also learned that flat slabs of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Caliche">caliche</a> were
ideal for lining fireplaces and to construct
primitive rock shelters.</p>
<p>A number of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pliocene">Pliocene</a> vertebrates have
been found in the Palo Duro area. Known
as the &ldquo;Age of Mammals,&rdquo; the Tertiary
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">Period</a> was characterized by mammals as
diverse as were the reptiles of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a>
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Era">Era</a>. Among these unusual creatures
were such now-extinct species as the saber-tooth
cat and the elephant-like shovel-jawed
mastodon (<a href="#fig18">fig. 18</a>). The remains of
these as well as bones of giraffe-like camels,
pony-sized horses, and sloths have been
found in the vicinity of the canyon. The
grassy plains of Pliocene time were also
inhabited by large tortoises which reached
lengths of up to 3 feet (<a href="#fig19">fig. 19</a>). Dioramas
showing how these animals might have
looked, as well as their actual remains, are
on display in the Hall of Pre-History in the
lower floor of the Panhandle-Plains Historical

<h2 id="c18">HOW THE CANYON WAS CARVED</h2>
<p>The visitor seeing Palo Duro Canyon
for the first time may find it difficult to believe
that this yawning chasm began as a
simple gully. But to the <i>geomorphologist</i>&mdash;the
geologist who studies the origin and
development of landscapes&mdash;Palo Duro
Canyon is but a gully magnified many
times over. This is evident because the
shape of the canyon, the nature of its tributaries,
and the character of its walls indicate
that it has been deepened and lengthened
by the downcutting of a stream and
widened by other geologic processes.</p>
<h3 id="c19">THE GEOLOGIC WORK OF RUNNING WATER</h3>
<p>Palo Duro Canyon is a classic example
of a land-form that has been created by
the geologic work of <i>running water</i>. Undoubtedly
the most important single agent
of erosion, running water probably does
more to wear away the land than all the
other geologic agents combined. This is
not surprising considering the fact that the
earth&rsquo;s annual precipitation (such as rain
and snow) equals about four billion tons
of water. Although the amount of precipitation
varies greatly from place to place,
the average annual precipitation on land is
about 40 inches of water. Of this, roughly
25 percent runs off from the land to form
streams.</p>
<p>When one drives through the park and
fords the normally gently flowing waters
of the Prairie Dog Town Fork of the Red River he may well wonder if this unimposing
stream actually is the geologic agent
that is responsible for this deep gorge. But
the visitor who happens to be present during
a severe rainstorm will soon be convinced,
for during heavy rains this gentle
stream becomes a raging torrent. As the
river increases in size it also becomes a
more effective land-shaping tool, for the
larger and swifter the stream, the more
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> material it can carry. Thus, when
flowing at peak capacity, this branch of
the Red River becomes a moving ribbon of
sandpaper whose load of sand, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Silt">silt</a>, and
gravel has cut and scoured the canyon walls
and floor for hundreds of thousands of
years. How long has it taken the river to
carve this remarkable chasm? Although
there is no way of knowing for sure, geologic evidence indicates that the canyon
has formed during the last one million
years&mdash;a relatively short time, geologically
speaking.</p>
<p>The work of the river is made still more
effective by water and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sediment">sediment</a> which it
receives from its tributaries; this added
water substantially increases the volume
and velocity of the river. Although many
of the tributary streams are dry throughout
much of the year, they carry large
quantities of water during heavy rains.
Moreover, because most of these streams
flow over <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> surfaces which are not protected
by thick soil or vegetation, their waters
are quickly transported to the master
stream. Thus, the volume and velocity of
the Prairie Dog Town Fork of the Red River make it possible&mdash;especially during
flood <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">periods</a>&mdash;for the river to carry a
large load of rock particles which effectively
erodes the stream channel. Where
does this rock debris come from? Most of
it is eroded from the sides and bottom of
the river&rsquo;s channel.</p>
<p>The river carries its load in a number of
ways. Material such as salt and other soluble
matter is transported in a dissolved state
or in <i>solution</i>. Still more, for example, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Silt">silt</a>
and fine sand, is carried in <i>suspension</i>.
These <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sediment">sediments</a> are suspended between the
surface of the water and the bottom of the
stream channel. Those particles that will
not dissolve in water and are too heavy to
be carried in suspension, constitute the
<i>bottom load</i> of the stream. These larger
sediments, such as gravel, cobbles, and
boulders, roll, bounce, or slide along the
stream bed.</p>
<p>As flash floods course through Palo Duro
Canyon, the river uses its load to erode
further the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> over which it passes. Each
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
moving rock fragment literally becomes a
cutting tool for <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Abrasion">abrasion</a></i> as the loose rock
particles slowly wear away the banks and
bed of the stream. Eventually the abraded
rock fragments become smooth and
rounded and the stream channel is gradually
worn down to a lower level; it is also
widened.</p>
<p>The river also erodes by <i>hydraulic action</i>
as loose <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> fragments are lifted and
moved by the force of the stream&rsquo;s current.
This process is similar to the effect produced
when soil is churned up and washed
away when water from a garden hose is
sprayed on loose earth. The effects of hydraulic
action have played an important
role in widening the canyon, for recession
of the cliffs away from the middle of the
canyons has been caused in part by undercutting.
Thus, as the soft <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shale">shale</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Gypsum">gypsum</a>
beds were removed by the stream, the overlying
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandstone">sandstone</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">formations</a> gradually
broke off and fell into the canyon. Once
on the canyon floor, most of the slabs and
blocks of sandstone were eventually broken
up and carried away by the streams as
sand and mud. Not all of the boulders have
been destroyed in this manner; in places
(for example, the Rock Garden) similar
boulders are seen today (<a href="#fig34">fig. 34</a>).</p>
<h3 id="c20"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Weathering">WEATHERING</a> AND GRAVITY ADD THE FINAL TOUCH</h3>
<p>Most of the energy of the river has been
expended in downcutting, for the canyon
has apparently been deepened more rapidly
than it has been widened. But as the
stream gouged its channel deeper into the
bedrock, an ever-increasing expanse of
canyon wall was exposed to other agents of
erosion. Slowly&mdash;almost imperceptibly&mdash;the
walls of the canyon have been eroded
by the processes of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Weathering">weathering</a> and mass-wasting.</p>
<h4 id="c21"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Weathering">Weathering</a>.&mdash;</h4>
<p>Wherever <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> are exposed
on the earth&rsquo;s surface, they are attacked
by the agents of <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Weathering">weathering</a></i>. They
are dissolved by rainwater, pried apart by
frost and ice, and blasted by windblown
sand. Some of the changes produced by
weathering are purely mechanical, that is,
the rock is simply reduced to smaller fragments
without being broken down chemically
or undergoing any change in its
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Mineral">mineral</a> composition. This <i>mechanical
weathering</i>, or <i>disintegration</i>, takes place
in a number of ways. Changes are especially
noticeable in rocks that are subjected
to large daily temperature variations. If a
crack in these rocks becomes filled with
water and the temperature drops below
freezing, ice forms. When water freezes it
expands by about 10 percent of its volume&mdash;this
is the reason why water pipes often
split open during the winter. Just as in a
water pipe, the pressure of the expanding
ice is commonly great enough to widen and
deepen the crack in the rock. This process,
called <i>frost wedging</i>, may ultimately cause
the rock to split and fall apart. The cumulative
effects of frost wedging have probably
played a significant role in prying off
large blocks of rocks from the walls and
rim of the canyon.</p>
<p>Animals and plants may also hasten <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a>
disintegration. Plant roots commonly grow
in rock crevices and as the roots become
larger they wedge the rock apart. Burrowing
animals such as rabbits, gophers, and
ground squirrels also promote rock disintegration.
Although they do not attack the
rocks directly, their digging exposes new
rock surfaces to <a class="gloss" href="#g_Weathering">weathering</a> processes. The
holes these creatures make also permit water
and air to enter the earth more easily,
thereby hastening rock destruction.</p>
<p>Man, of course, promotes more <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> disintegration
than all other animals combined.
Thus, as one explores the canyon&rsquo;s
trails and climbs its walls, he will not only
see evidence of the various types of mechanical
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Weathering">weathering</a>, he will also be contributing
to the further wearing away of
the rocks.</p>
<p><i>Decomposition</i>, or <i>chemical <a class="gloss" href="#g_Weathering">weathering</a></i>,
works hand in hand with mechanical
weathering. But unlike disintegration, decomposition
produces <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> materials that
are basically different from the original
unweathered rock. These changes are
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
brought about as the result of chemical
reactions between <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mineral">minerals</a> in the rocks
and water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen.
Although the arid climate and severe winters
of the Panhandle generally facilitate
mechanical weathering, some of the red <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shale">shales</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Gypsum">gypsum</a> deposits show the effect
of oxidation, hydration, and other forms
of chemical weathering (<a href="#fig10">fig. 10</a>).</p>
<h4 id="c22">Mass-wasting.&mdash;</h4>
<p><i>Mass-wasting</i>, the erosional
process by which <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> and soil move
downslope in response to the force of gravity,
has also been instrumental in shaping
Palo Duro Canyon. This type of erosion
has been especially active on the walls of
the canyon, for here the slopes are steep
enough to promote downward movement
of earth materials. In a few places there
have been landslides which have moved
large quantities of rock in a short span of
time. But most mass movements have been
imperceptibly slow as masses of <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Talus">talus</a></i> (accumulations
of rock debris) on steeper
slopes have inched slowly downhill because
of their own weight. Talus deposits produced
in this way can be seen at the foot
of most of the cliffs and erosional remnants
throughout the canyon (<a href="#fig20">fig. 20</a>).</p>
<h4 id="c23">Differential erosion.&mdash;</h4>
<p>Even the most casual
observer will soon note that not all of
the canyon&rsquo;s <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> have been equally affected
by erosion. Indeed, it is the nature
of this <i>differential erosion</i> that gives Palo
Duro Canyon the rugged sculptured appearance
that accounts for much of its
beauty.</p>
<p>Visitors to Palo Duro Canyon commonly
ask why the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">rock formations</a> are so diversely
shaped. The answer to this question
lies in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> themselves. Because the
various rock <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stratum">strata</a> are of unequal hardness,
they erode at different rates of speed.
Hence, the harder, more resistant rocks,
such as the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandstone">sandstones</a> and conglomerates
of the Trujillo Formation, form the shelves,
ledges, and &ldquo;caps&rdquo; of the rock sculptures.
The Lighthouse (<a href="#fig31">fig. 31</a>) and other pedestal
rocks (<a href="#fig16">fig. 16</a>) are good examples of
land-forms produced by differential erosion.
The &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Hoodoo">hoodoos</a>&rdquo; mentioned earlier are
also the products of this type of erosion
(figs. <a href="#fig16">16</a> and <a href="#fig20">20</a>).</p>
<div class="img" id="fig20">
<img src="images/pmg018.jpg" alt="" width="719" height="500" />
<p class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 20.</span> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Talus">Talus</a> slopes (arrow) are well developed on the east side of Capitol Peak and in places
obscure the Quartermaster <a class="gloss" href="#g_RedBeds">red beds</a>. Note the &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Hoodoo">hoodoo</a>&rdquo; at the south (left) end of the structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Softer <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> like <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shale">shales</a> and clay are
more readily eroded and they normally
form slopes rather than cliffs or ledges (<a href="#fig12">fig. 12</a>).
Grooves, recesses, and caves have
also developed in some of the less resistant
rocks such as the shales and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Gypsum">gypsum</a> beds
of the Quartermaster <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formation</a>. Catarina
Cave (<a href="#fig27">fig. 27</a>) which has formed in the red and white shales of the Spanish Skirts (<a href="#fig26">fig. 26</a>)
is a good example of this type of feature.
Caves of this type afforded protection
to both man and wild animals since the
dawn of history, for their remains have
been found in a number of similar caves.</p>
<p>Thus, within a relatively short time&mdash;geologically
speaking&mdash;the familiar land-shaping
processes described above have
joined forces to provide Texas with one
of its most remarkable natural attractions.
But interestingly enough, the same geologic processes that created these unusual <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">formations</a>
are busily at work destroying them.
As time passes and erosion progresses, the
caps of the pedestals are worn away and
the underlying <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shale">shales</a> crumble and are
washed into the valley below. Yet even as
the old land-forms are being destroyed,
wind, water, ice, and man are attacking
the canyon walls to produce still more of
these interesting erosional remnants.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<h2 id="c24">WHAT TO DO AND SEE AT PALO DURO CANYON STATE PARK</h2>
<p>The visitor to Palo Duro Canyon can
choose from a number of recreational and
educational activities. Moreover, regardless
of whether one visits for a few hours
to picnic along the banks of the river, or
spends a week at one of the well-kept campgrounds,
the visit will probably be both
pleasant and rewarding. In the pages that
follow there is a brief description of certain
of the park landmarks and some of
the more popular attractions within the
canyon. The numbers in parentheses refer
to numbers which designate these places on
the map of Palo Duro Canyon (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>, pp. <a href="#Page_4">4</a>-5).
Hopefully, this information will help
one to plan his visit to the canyon and
thereby make his stay more enjoyable and
worthwhile.</p>
<h4 id="c25"><i>Park Entrance</i> (1).&mdash;</h4>
<p>The first stop in
the park is the gate at the ranger station
(<a href="#fig21">fig. 21</a>). Here one pays a modest admission
fee and receives literature and information
about the park. The park is open
every day of the year, but the entrance
gates close at sundown.</p>
<h4 id="c26"><i>Coronado Lodge and Observation Point</i> (2).&mdash;</h4>
<p>The overlook at Coronado Lodge
(<a href="#fig22">fig. 22</a>), located about half a mile from
the Park Entrance, is a good place to start
one&rsquo;s visit. Situated on a ledge of Ogallala
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Caliche">caliche</a> (<a href="#Page_26">p. 26</a>), the Lodge is an attractive,
rustic structure constructed of blocks of
Trujillo <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandstone">sandstone</a> (<a href="#Page_22">p. 22</a>). Its picture
windows and outdoor overlook provide a
matchless view of the canyon and make it
possible to become oriented for the descent
to the canyon floor. Large, coin-operated
telescopes permit close-up views of distant
parts of the canyon, and there are museum
cases containing objects of historical and
geological interest from the Palo Duro
area. If possible one should visit the Coronado
Observation Point more than once
during the visit, preferably at different
times of the day. Because of shifting clouds
and changing lighting conditions, the canyon
presents a continually changing panorama
from sunrise to sunset. Open year-round,
the Lodge offers a complete line of
souvenirs, film, and camping supplies.
There is also a snack bar where coffee,
sandwiches, and cold drinks can be purchased.</p>
<h4 id="c27"><i>The Scenic Drive</i> (1-16).&mdash;</h4>
<p>After viewing
the canyon from Coronado Lodge, one
should take the scenic drive on Park Road
5. This paved, all-weather road descends
the northwest rim of the canyon and continues
on to the turnaround at Cow Camp,
a distance of about 8 miles. Although the
present scenic drive was completed in
1951, the path that it follows is essentially
that which was laid out by Colonel Charles
Goodnight when he established Palo Duro
ranch in 1876. The road descends to the
canyon floor in a series of well-engineered
turns, but because it drops some 800 feet
in little more than a mile it is wise to use
second or low gear on the descent. One
should also observe the posted speed limits
(10 to 20 miles per hour) and keep to the
right side of the road at all times.</p>
<p>In the 800-foot drop from rim to floor,
the complete geologic section of the canyon
is traversed, as one passes from the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>
sands through the Ogallala, Trujillo,
and Tecovas <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formations</a>, before reaching
the Quartermaster Formation which is exposed
in the canyon floor. Each of these
geologic formations is discussed elsewhere
in this publication (pp. <a href="#Page_16">16</a>-28).</p>
<h4 id="c28"><i>Pioneer Amphitheatre</i> (3).&mdash;</h4>
<p>Upon
reaching the canyon floor, Park Road 5
flattens out and from this point it is but
a short distance to the Pioneer Amphitheatre,
one of the canyon&rsquo;s newest and
most popular attractions. Here, located at
the foot of a colorful 600-foot cliff, is a
remarkable 1500-seat outdoor theatre of
latest design (<a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>). Each evening during
a ten-week summer season, a symphonic
drama portraying the history of the
Texas Panhandle is presented in the amphitheatre.
Information about these productions
can be obtained at the Park Entrance,
Coronado Lodge, and other points within
the park.</p>

<h4 id="c29"><i>Sad Monkey Train Ride</i> (4).&mdash;</h4>
<p>The Sad
Monkey Railroad begins&mdash;and ends&mdash;at
Sad Monkey, Texas, a small &ldquo;community&rdquo;
that lies at the foot of Triassic Peak (<a href="#fig24">fig. 24</a>).
Unlike most miniature railroads, the
Sad Monkey Special is not a &ldquo;kiddie&rdquo; ride.
Instead, this 2-mile journey provides an
opportunity to get away from the road for
a closer look at the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">geologic formations</a>
exposed along the track. There are especially
good views of the Spanish Skirts
(<a href="#fig26">fig. 26</a>), Catarina Cave (<a href="#fig27">fig. 27</a>), and
Triassic Peak (<a href="#fig25">fig. 25</a>). These, and other
features of geologic interest, are pointed
out by an experienced lecturer who also
presents a brief review of the geologic history
of the area.</p>
<h4 id="c30"><i>Triassic Peak</i> (5).&mdash;</h4>
<p>Long used by Indians
and ranchers as a Palo Duro landmark,
the canyon visitor will find Triassic
Peak to be equally useful as a geologic landmark. When viewed from the Sad
Monkey Railroad Terminal, the south face
of Triassic Peak clearly reveals three of
the four major <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">geologic formations</a> of the
canyon (<a href="#fig25">fig. 25</a>).</p>
<div class="img" id="fig23">

symphonic dramas are presented each summer. (Courtesy Mrs. Ples Harper, Texas Panhandle
Heritage Foundation, Inc.; photograph by Ron Horn.)</p>
</div>
<p>The lower one-third of the peak consists
of deeply furrowed, red and white banded
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Shale">shales</a> of the Quartermaster <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formation</a> (<a href="#Page_17">p. 17</a>).
Overlying the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_RedBeds">red beds</a> are
the brightly colored, multi-hued Tecovas
shales of Triassic age (<a href="#Page_19">p. 19</a>). The composition
of the Tecovas is such that the
lower shales tend to weather into relatively
gentle slopes with rather smooth surfaces.
Triassic Peak is capped by a weather-resistant
layer of Trujillo <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandstone">sandstone</a>, and
this durable cliff-forming sandstone has
served as a protective covering to impede
the erosion of the softer <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rocks</a> of the Tecovas
and Quartermaster Formations. Although
it has withstood the ravages of
time exceedingly well, the large blocks of
Trujillo sandstone which litter the flanks
and foot of Triassic Peak clearly indicate
that <a class="gloss" href="#g_Weathering">weathering</a> and mass-wasting have
exacted their toll in the geologic past.</p>

known as the Sad Monkey is indicated by the arrow.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Sad Monkey, Texas derives its name
from the prominent mass of Trujillo <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandstone">sandstone</a>
at the southern extremity of Triassic
Peak. When viewed in the proper perspective&mdash;and
with the proper amount of imagination&mdash;this
massive block of sandstone
bears a striking resemblance to an aged
and saddened monkey.</p>
<h4 id="c31"><i>Spanish Skirts</i> (6).&mdash;</h4>
<p>Few of the canyon&rsquo;s
features are as well-named as the
gaudy Spanish Skirts (<a href="#fig26">fig. 26</a>). The lower
part of this multi-colored bluff consists of
alternating layers of red and white Quartermaster
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Shale">shale</a>, capped by the colorful
maroon and lavender Tecovas shales. Located
on the north flank of Timber Mesa,
the Spanish Skirts and nearby Catarina
Cave can be reached by an easy half-mile
path. The trail begins on the west side of
Park Road 5, just beyond the Timber
Creek bridge located several hundred feet
from the Sad Monkey Station.</p>
<h4 id="c32"><i>Catarina Cave</i> (7).&mdash;</h4>
<p>A short distance
west of the Spanish Skirts lies Catarina
Cave. This depression has been washed
out of the relatively soluble <a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shale">shales</a>
(<a href="#fig27">fig. 27</a>).</p>
<h4 id="c33"><i>Santana&rsquo;s Face</i> (8).&mdash;</h4>
<p>Like Triassic
Peak, Timber Mesa is capped by a thick
layer of massively bedded Trujillo <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandstone">sandstone</a>.
On the eastern tip of the mesa the
sandstone has been eroded in such a fashion
that it resembles the profile of an Indian
(<a href="#fig28">fig. 28</a>). This feature, called Santana&rsquo;s
Face, is best seen from the park
road shortly after leaving Sad Monkey Station.</p>

<h4 id="c34"><i>The Sky Ride</i> (9).&mdash;</h4>
<p>The Sky Ride, located
near the first water crossing on Park
Road 5, transports visitors from the canyon
floor to the top of Timber Mesa (<a href="#fig28">fig. 28</a>).
The 300-foot ascent is made in ski-lift
chairs that are comfortable and safe. The
observation area atop the mesa offers an
unusually fine view of most parts of the
canyon.</p>

<h4 id="c35"><i>The First Water Crossing</i> (10).&mdash;</h4>
<p>As it
winds through the canyon, the park road
crosses the Prairie Dog Town Fork of the
Red River seven times in a distance of
about 4 miles. These fords, or water crossings
as they are called locally, are paved
and are normally safe to pass through. They
should, however, be avoided during times
of heavy rains and flash flooding. Because
of stream erosion, especially fine exposures
of the Quartermaster <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formation</a> are revealed
in the stream banks near several of
the crossings.</p>
<p>The first of these crossings (<a href="#fig29">fig. 29</a>) is
about 1 mile from the Sad Monkey Station
and is one of the more popular picnic
areas in the park. This area was also popular
with earlier residents of the park, for
it is believed to have been the campgrounds
of both the Kiowa and Comanche Indians.</p>
<h4 id="c36"><i>Colonel Charles Goodnight&rsquo;s Dugout</i> (11).&mdash;</h4>
<p>As mentioned earlier (<a href="#Page_6">p. 6</a>) Colonel
Charles Goodnight entered the canyon
in 1876 with more than 16,000 head
of cattle. Although he later established
more comfortable quarters, Col. Goodnight
first lived in a primitive dugout similar to
the one shown in <a href="#fig30">figure 30</a>. A replica of
this early shelter has been constructed of
mud, stone, and logs and can be seen on
the west side of the park road just beyond
the first water crossing (<i>see</i> <a href="#fig29">fig. 29</a>).</p>
<div class="img" id="fig29">

<p class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 29.</span> Now a popular picnic spot, the wooded area near the first water crossing through the
Prairie Dog Town Fork of the Red River was a favorite Indian campground.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="c37"><i>The Lighthouse</i> (12).&mdash;</h4>
<p>The unpaved
road to the Lighthouse enters Park Road
5 about two-tenths of a mile beyond the
first water crossing. Although considered
by many to be the canyon&rsquo;s best-known
landmark, the Lighthouse is actually not
within park boundaries. It is located in
Little Sunday Canyon about 3 miles west
of the road and is not easily accessible to
the average visitor. Like many of the park&rsquo;s
natural attractions, the Lighthouse is an
erosional remnant of colorful Trujillo
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Shale">shales</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandstone">sandstones</a> (<a href="#fig31">fig. 31</a>). A similar
pedestal <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a>, the Devil&rsquo;s Tombstone, can
be reached by means of a trail which leaves
the Lighthouse road and enters Sunday
Canyon.</p>

</div>
<h4 id="c38"><i>Capitol Peak</i> (13).&mdash;</h4>
<p>Capitol Peak (figs. <a href="#fig20">20</a> and <a href="#fig32">32</a>)
is a rather imposing geologic feature that can be seen from a number of
points along Park Road 5. There are especially
good views in the vicinity of the
second water crossing if one will look to
the west of the road. Just beyond the crossing
an unimproved road leads to the foot
of Capitol Peak. The lower part of this feature
is composed of Quartermaster <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shale">shales</a>
of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a> age and the upper section consists
largely of Triassic Tecovas shales.
When viewed from the proper angle, the
silhouette of Capitol Peak is thought to
resemble the prostrate form of a human
(<a href="#fig32">fig. 32</a>). For this reason it has also been
called the Sleeping Indian.</p>
<h4 id="c39"><i>Fortress Cliff</i> (14).&mdash;</h4>
<p>The Ogallala <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">Formation</a>
of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pliocene">Pliocene</a> age (<a href="#Page_23">p. 23</a>) forms the
upper rim of the canyon and is well exposed
in impressive Fortress Cliff (<a href="#fig33">fig. 33</a>).
Although this precipitous cliff dominates
the eastern rim of the canyon along most
of the scenic drive, especially good views
are afforded between the second and third
water crossings.</p>
<h4 id="c40"><i>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">Rock</a> Garden</i> (15).&mdash;</h4>
<p>Shortly after
fording the river at the fifth water crossing,
there is a jumbled pile of boulders on
the west side of the road (<a href="#fig34">fig. 34</a>). This
accumulation of Trujillo <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sandstone">sandstone</a> blocks
has been named the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">Rock</a> Garden. Many
boulders such as these have accumulated
on the floor of the canyon in ages past.
However, most of these have been destroyed
by <a class="gloss" href="#g_Weathering">weathering</a> and their fragments
removed by the canyon&rsquo;s streams.</p>
<h4 id="c41"><i>The Devil&rsquo;s Slide</i> (16).&mdash;</h4>
<p>The Devil&rsquo;s
Slide can be reached by an unimproved
road that leads southwest from the scenic
drive for a distance of about half a mile.
Composed of upper Quartermaster and
lower Tecovas <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shale">shales</a>, the surface of this
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
eroded spur is laced with many trails and
&ldquo;slides&rdquo; that have been made by previous
visitors (<a href="#fig35">fig. 35</a>).</p>

</div>
<h4 id="c42"><i>The Turnaround</i> (17).&mdash;</h4>
<p>A loop marks
the end of Park Road 5 and the conclusion
of the scenic drive. Located in this area
are a number of fine camping areas, picnic
grounds, the old stone cottages called
the &ldquo;Cow Cabins,&rdquo; and rest rooms with
shower facilities (<a href="#fig36">fig. 36</a>).</p>

</div>
<h4 id="c43"><i>Hiking.</i>&mdash;</h4>
<p>There are a number of established
trails for the visitor who is interested
in hiking. The more popular trails include
those to the Spanish Skirts and Catarina
Cave (<a href="#Page_37">p. 37</a>), the Devil&rsquo;s Tombstone, the
Lighthouse (<a href="#Page_39">p. 39</a>), and the Devil&rsquo;s Slide
(<a href="#Page_40">p. 40</a>). Park rangers will be glad to provide
more complete information about
these and other trails within the canyon.</p>
<h4 id="c44"><i>Horseback riding.</i>&mdash;</h4>
<p>Saddle horses can
be rented at the stables located east of the
road near the Pioneer Amphitheatre. There
are a number of trail rides that can be
taken on well-trained horses accustomed
to the rugged terrain of the canyon. Additional
information may be obtained from
the attendants at the stable.</p>
<h4 id="c45"><i>Camping and picnicking.</i>&mdash;</h4>
<p>An ample
number of well-developed camping and
picnic areas are scattered throughout the
canyon. Most are located adjacent to or a
short distance from Park Road 5; they are
equipped with outdoor fireplaces and
tables. Running water, rest rooms, and
showers are provided in certain areas.
Campsites are available on a first-come
first-served basis, and there is a 10-day
limit on overnight camping. Detailed information
on camping regulations and
camping areas is available from a park
ranger or at the Entrance Station.</p>
<h4 id="c46"><i>Photography.</i>&mdash;</h4>
<p>Palo Duro Canyon offers
many opportunities for both amateur and
professional photography. The multi-colored
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">rock formations</a>, erosional land-forms,
and plants and animals offer limitless possibilities
to the creative and imaginative
photographer. Color shots are especially
effective, but a haze filter will be helpful
when photographing distant objects. Morning
and afternoon are the best times for
picture taking as the mid-day sun is &ldquo;flat&rdquo;
and lends little perspective to the canyon
scene.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig37">
<img src="images/pmg025b.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="727" />
<p class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 37.</span> Located on the campus of West Texas State University in Canyon, the Panhandle-Plains
Historical Museum has many exhibits of historical and geological interest that will enhance one&rsquo;s
visit to Palo Duro Canyon State Park. (Courtesy Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum.)</p>
</div>
<p>The visitor to Palo Duro Canyon State
Park would do well to start his visit at the
Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum located
on the campus of West Texas State
University in Canyon (<a href="#fig37">fig. 37</a>). Here all
phases of history&mdash;recent, archeologic, and
geologic&mdash;are depicted in the various halls.
In the Hall of Pre-History are the fossilized
remains and reconstructions of ancient animals
that were entombed in the canyon
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
walls as long as 200 million years ago.
Elsewhere there are exhibits and dioramas
that portray human history in the Palo
Duro area. Beginning with the oldest
known evidence of human occupation
about 12,000 years ago, there is a succession
of displays that tell the story of man
in the Palo Duro&mdash;High Plains region.
These exhibits follow man from the early
Indians living in stone shelters, to the
horse-using nomadic plains Indians who
relied heavily on the great herds of bison
and who fought a desperate but losing battle
to save their homeland from invasion
by the white man. Here, too, is the story of
the coming of the Spanish conquistadores,
the <i>comancheros</i> (<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_6">p. 6</a>), and the advent
of the anglican settler. All are portrayed
by means of artifacts that represent
the different cultures of the region&rsquo;s colorful
past.</p>
<p>The major theme of the Museum is the
history of the High Plains during the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a> of the cattle industry of the open
range. One entire hall is devoted to the display
of saddles, spurs, lariats, barbed wire,
branding irons, a chuck wagon, and a life
size model of a typical cowboy of the Old
West. The Museum also houses one of the
nation&rsquo;s finest collections of guns of the
Old West, the Old World, and guns of today.
Other highlights include scale models
depicting scenes of the Old West, exhibits
of typical rooms from pioneer homes furnished
with furniture of that <a class="gloss" href="#g_Era">era</a>, a fine assortment
of antique vehicles, and famous
collections of Western art.</p>
<p>The Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum
is easily reached from any of the
major highways that pass through Canyon.
It is open from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.
weekdays and from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.
Sundays.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
